In the early morning, at Space and Time Conference 2020 in Piano di Sorrento, an exciting announcement has been done: Time travels are a real possibility. A team of researchers and PhDs has show how this kind of travel could be done. The conference has highlighted new horizons in physics and astrophysics associated with the existence of a Time Machine. Examining these fundamental issues they provided a real way to initiate the development of such a time machine. Be aware of the difficulty of this task! You will explore the role of causality and the interplay between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, two theories that on their own have been extensively verified by experiment but have not yet been successfully combined into a single unified theory.
